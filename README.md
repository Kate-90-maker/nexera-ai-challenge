🧪 Prototype 1 — AI-Generated 3D Learning Asset (Mocked)

This prototype demonstrates the AI reasoning and content-generation layer of a text-to-3D educational pipeline.

Users enter a text description of a real-world object (e.g., “yellow hard hat”). The system simulates AI analysis to classify the object, generate structured educational content, and prepare a corresponding 3D asset for learner interaction.

For demo reliability and cost control, the AI output is mocked. However, the system architecture mirrors a real production flow where:

AI models would generate or retrieve suitable 3D assets

Assets would be standardized (GLB conversion, scaling, materials)

Content would be presented in an interactive 3D viewer

This approach allows the pipeline to be easily extended with live AI inference and real 3D models.
